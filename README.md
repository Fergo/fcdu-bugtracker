# Fergo Virtual CDU - Bug Tracker

Fergo Virtual CDU is a virtual Control Display Unit for MSFS' PMDG 737 aircraft series. It allows you to remote control the plane's Flight Management Computer (FMC) with soft-buttons and a 1:1 representation of the display in real time. Accessible through your regular web-browser, you can use it in a second monitor or any other device connected to your home network, such as a phone or tablet/iPad.
